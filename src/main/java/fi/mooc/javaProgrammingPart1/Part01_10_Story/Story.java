/*
Write a program that asks the user for a character's name and their job.
The program then prints a short story.

The output must be as shown below â€” note, the name and job depend on the user's input.

Sample output
I will tell you a story, but I need some information first.
What is the main character called?
Bob (user input)
What is their job?
a builder (user input)
Here is the story:
Once upon a time there was Bob, who was a builder.
On the way to work, Bob reflected on life.
Perhaps Bob will not be a builder forever.
